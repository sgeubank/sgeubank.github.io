<A href=M912-35-0078-0089.pdf> The entries related to FQCG </A> in the "Name and Subject Index to the General Correspondence of the War Plans Division". 
The general correspondence and the index are part of Records of the War Department General and Special Staffs, Record Group 165. 
From the "file number" field in each entry, you can (usually) get the microfilm reel, which may or may not have been digitized yet. If not digitized, the reel should be available to the public at the Archives in Maryland.

A subscription-based research service has put together collections of War Department correspondence on specific issues. (That's what Huston ran across that got me started on this in the first place).
They have photos of the actual telegrams, but I couldn't find an easy way to download them even with a (free) trial membership. <A href=FQCG-in-archives.pdf>Here</A> is a list of what they have and here are some screenshots:
